# Time Series Forecasting using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in TensorFlow

Time Series Data: Each data point in a time series is linked to a timestamp, which shows the exact time when the data was observed or recorded. Many fields, including finance, economics, weather forecasting, and machine learning, frequently employ this kind of data.

The fact that time series data frequently display patterns or trends across time, such as seasonality or cyclical patterns, is an essential feature associated with it. To make predictions or learn more about the underlying processes or occurrences being observed, these patterns can be analyzed and modeled.
